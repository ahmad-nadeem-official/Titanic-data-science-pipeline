🧠 Reusable EDA Pipeline Project – Report
-----------------------------------------

**Author**: Ahmad  
**Date**: May 1, 2025  
**Main Goal**: To create a **modular, interactive, and reusable Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) pipeline** that works not only for Titanic but for **any tabular dataset**.

* * *

### 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to **automate and standardize the EDA process** through a Python class-based pipeline. The pipeline is designed to allow data scientists and analysts to quickly:

*   Understand the structure of any dataset.
    
*   Handle missing values.
    
*   Perform one-hot encoding.
    
*   Normalize or scale features.
    
*   Visualize data distributions and correlations.
    
*   Remove outliers.
    
*   Save the cleaned data for further use.
    

This system aims to **speed up EDA workflows**, especially in iterative or multiple-dataset environments.

* * *

### 🏗️ Core Component: `EDA` Class

Implemented in `eda.py`, the `EDA` class provides a comprehensive toolkit for:

*   📊 **Data Summary**: Viewing dataset shape, column names, types, and statistical summaries.
    
*   📈 **Visualization**:
    
    *   Histograms for all features.
        
    *   Correlation heatmaps (global or selective).
        
    *   Histplot for variable comparison.
        
    *   Boxplots for outlier detection.
        
*   🧹 **Data Cleaning**:
    
    *   Handle missing values using various strategies.
        
    *   Drop specified columns or duplicates.
        
    *   Normalize or scale columns using MinMaxScaler.
        
    *   Apply one-hot encoding to categorical features.
        
    *   Remove outliers using the IQR method.
        
*   💾 **Export**:
    
    *   Save cleaned datasets to CSV.
        

#### ✅ Reusability Features

*   Fully reusable by simply providing a different CSV path.
    
*   Built-in CLI-like options make it dataset-agnostic.
    
*   Can be expanded with new cleaning or visualization methods easily.
    

* * *

### ⚙️ How It Works

python

CopyEdit

`from eda import EDA

# Example usage on any dataset:
eda_tool = EDA("YourDataset.csv")
eda_tool.run()  # CLI-based method to explore and clean the dataset`

### 🧪 Demonstration on Titanic Dataset

To test the EDA pipeline, the Titanic dataset was used as a case study. Key results:

*   Missing values were handled successfully.
    
*   Outliers in age/fare were detected and removed.
    
*   Data was normalized.
    
*   Dataset was encoded and saved to `cleaned_titanic.csv`.
    

Modeling was later applied using `model.py` to validate the usefulness of cleaned data.

### 🌟 Achievements

*   ✅ Created a highly **modular, extendable EDA class**.
    
*   ✅ Pipeline works on **any dataset** without rewriting code.
    
*   ✅ Reduced time for data inspection and preparation.
    
*   ✅ Demonstrated pipeline usability on Titanic dataset.

### 📌 Future Enhancements

*   Wrap the `EDA` class into a **Python package (PyPI)** for easier import and sharing.
    
*   Add **logging** and **automated report generation** (PDF or HTML).
    
*   Add support for **time series** or **text-based datasets**.
    
*   Build a **GUI version** using Streamlit or Tkinter.
